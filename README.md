# Introduction
This project is designed to build a load balancer through terraform orchestration and also allows for the management of Google VMâ€™s via external interface IP address through Ansible via gce.ini and gce.py files.

It should be known that I have had only 1 week to get myself familiar with GCP and its concepts and I am very much a novice when it comes to GCP.

However I have not let this deter me from attempting to complete the project.

## The Requirements of Project

 - [x] Create a new Google Platform Project 
 - [x] Use f1-micro instances
 - [ ] Ensure the enviroment is completely secure
 - [x] Use Nginx/Apache or SimpleHTTPServer
 - [x] Return the correct headers
 - [x] If a server dies rebuild and re-add to the LB
 - [x] Minimum size of server auto-scaling group 1 and max 2
 - [x] IAM Acess

## Getting started
1. Sign into google cloud and create a project
2. Type in the search bar API and services --> API library --> Google Compute Engine API
3. Enable the Google Compute Engine API for the project
4. Create a service account on google cloud

      1. Once an account has been created go to the API Dashboard this can be done by typing API into the search bar and then selecting Credentials APIs & Services
      
      1. Once at the screen click on Create credentials --> Service account key --> Create Service account and then select Compute Engine default service account if avalible if not then click on New service account and then enter a name for the Service account and then click on next, select the role as Compute Engine --> Compute Admin and then click on create. This will then create a .json file save this file as account.json
      
      1. For more information about service account click ont the link https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/service-accounts
         1. The Link explains that a service account is a special account used by GCE instances tointeract with other google Plaform API's. Service credentials can be used to allow applications to authorize themselves to a set of APIs and perform actions within the permissions granted to the service account and virtual machine instance.
         
     1. For more information about API Credentials, access, security, and identity click on this link ttps://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158857?hl=en
     
5.	Then git clone https://github.com/dc232/Google_test_task.git
6. The project comes with 2 executable files, one called runme and the other ansible
7. Move the account.json file to the project directory (Google_test_task) and also to the static_IP/ folder
     1.  Modify the variable GMAIL_ACCOUNT_USERNAME_FOR_SSH as this needed to create a username for the SSH key setup under metada in GCP. the username is added as a comment to the puplic key in this case named gcloud_instance_key.pub located in the vm_instance_keypair folder upon creation as seen in the snippet below.
``` 
ssh_key_creation_for_instances () {
    mkdir vm_instance_keypair
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4906 -f vm_instance_keypair/gcloud_instance_key -C $GMAIL_ACCOUNT_USERNAME_FOR_SSH -N ''
    #N '' means no passphrase but can be added for additional security
    echo "Restricting acess to private key IE setting readonly acess"
    sleep 2
    chmod 400 vm_instance_keypair/gcloud_instance_key
}

``` 
8. The runme file also executes the Ansible file to install 
Bullet list Ansible
     1.  To just build just the load balancer use vi runme and then disable the nested function Ansible_Integration as seen below

```  
       overall_script () {
    terraform_install_check
    ssh_key_creation_for_instances
    terraform_static_global_IP_init
    certifcate_creation
    terraform_load_balancer_init
#    Ansible_Integration
    Add_ssh_keys_ssh_agent
}
```
      
## Loadbalancer
## Autoscaling
## Security
